/*
Synchronous operations are executed sequentially, 
meaning that each operation must complete before 
the next one starts. The JavaScript engine processes 
code line by line, blocking execution until the current 
operation is finished.

//asynchronous
/*
Asynchronous operations are executed independently of the main 
program flow. They allow the program to perform tasks like waiting 
for data from a server, reading files, or handling user input without 
blocking the execution of subsequent code. This is achieved through 
mechanisms like callbacks, promises.
