# Assignment 3

## Problem Statement

Using the React framework, create and display a list of **3 patient appointments**. Each appointment should include the following details:

- **Patient's Name**
- **Reason for Appointment**
- **Appointment Date**
- **Status** (e.g., _Scheduled_, _Completed_)

### Functional Requirements

1. Add a button for each appointment that, when clicked:

   - Changes the status of the selected appointment to `"Completed"`.
   - Recalculates and displays the total number of completed appointments.

2. Use an array of objects to store the appointment details.

3. Use a **style object variable** for custom styling, as you would in JavaScript.
